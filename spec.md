# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand and redesign the existing community app into "Tribes Of Rudra" — a Shiva & Hinduism-focused spiritual community platform with a fully themed UI, dedicated landing page, and spiritually relevant content throughout.

**Planned changes:**
- Rebrand all visible app references from "ConnectHub" to "Tribes Of Rudra" (browser title, NavBar, Footer, etc.)
- Redesign the visual theme to a Hindu spiritual aesthetic: saffron/orange, gold accents, sacred ash grey, and midnight indigo palette with bold reverent typography and smooth meditative transitions
- Create a new landing/home page with: full-width hero banner ("Tribes Of Rudra" title + "Har Har Mahadev — Connect. Grow. Serve." tagline), "Who We Are" section, four spiritual pillar cards (Devotion, Sewa, Knowledge, Global Connection), "Good Cause" section, and a join/login call-to-action
- Replace predefined interest tags on Profile Setup and Discover People pages with Hindu/Shiva-themed tags (Shaivism, Vedanta, Yoga, Meditation, Bhakti, Sewa, Sanskrit, Ayurveda, Pilgrimage, Mantra & Chanting, Sacred Texts, Rudraksha, Tantra, Temple Arts, Hinduism)
- Update Community Feed page hero with a devotional welcome message referencing Lord Shiva, and update the post creation placeholder to encourage sharing spiritual insights, prayers, or seva stories

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a fully rebranded, spiritually themed Hindu community platform centered on Lord Shiva, with a rich landing page, themed interest tags, and devotional copy throughout the app.
